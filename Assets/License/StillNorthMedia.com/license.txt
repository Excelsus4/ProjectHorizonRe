The Free Firearm Sound Library was where it all began. We set out to provide a crowd funded library of high quality firearm sound effects that, once published, would become free forever to all the wonderful people in the sound community. After a rousing success, we revisited crowd funding to produce the Medieval Weapons Sound Effects Library. These libraries took a lot of blood, sweat, and tears (literally) to produce. You may use any of our sounds freely, with no royalties, and no credit needs to be given (although it is always appreciated). If you like, send us an email about your project that uses our sounds, we always love to see where they end up. We have divided our sounds into several groups, and you can direct download them via our Mediafire file storage for free!
